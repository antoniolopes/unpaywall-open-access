# Unpaywall API #

This is a simple python script to describe how to get data from the [Unpaywall API](https://unpaywall.org/products/api) to detect if a particular publication (identified by its [DOI](https://www.doi.org)) is available as Open Access or not. And if so, retrieve the URL where the Open Access PDF is available.

## To run the example ##

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```
